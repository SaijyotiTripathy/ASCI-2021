# About Project

Since Twitter is one of the most comprehensive sources of live, public conversation worldwide, this project uses the dataset containing the tweets related to people's opinions
on National Education Policy 2020. This program will be capable of parsing the tweets fetched from twitter and understanding the textâ€™s sentiments,
like its polarity and subjectivity. This project aims to figure out the general opinion on NEP 2020 and which may be used to make better strategies and plan for the future.  
This project is related to machine learning since we will be using supervised learning algorithms to train our model.

Tech stack used : 
Python
NLTK( Natural Language Processing Toolkit)
TextBlob
RE(Regular Expression)
